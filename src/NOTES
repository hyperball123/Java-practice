> UNTIL JAVA 1.7 WE DIDNT HAD THE ABILITY TO DEFINE METHODS IN AN INTERFACE BUT IN THE JAVA 1.8 THEY MADE SOME BIG
  CHANGES UPDATES, WHICH ALLOWES DEVELOPERS TO ACTUALLY DEFINE METHODS INSIDE THE INTERFACE RATHER THAN DECLARING IT

> Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a
  separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code has to be provided in
  the class implementing the same interface. To overcome this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods
  which allow the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface.

> u can also create static method inside interface

> lamda expression - we are avoiding lots of boiler plate code and the creation of
  class just for the implementation of class and directly write the implementation
  where we are creating an instance
